  abstract = {"The unprecedented growth of data and its ubiquity in our daily lives signal that the digital revolution is transforming the world. But despite this growth, much of the value of data remains untapped, waiting to be realized. Data collected for one particular purpose has the potential to generate economic value in applications far beyond those originally anticipated. However, many barriers stand in the way of such beneficial reuse of data, ranging from misaligned incentives and incompatible data systems to a fundamental lack of trust. The World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives will explore the tremendous potential of the changing data landscape to improve the lives of poor people, but also to open backdoors that can harm individuals, businesses, and societies. The first part of the report assesses how better use and reuse of data can enhance the design of public policies, programs, and service delivery, as well as improve market efficiency and job creation through private sector growth. The second part of the report focuses on issues of governance, law, policy, and infrastructure that can help realize data's potential benefits while safeguarding against harmful outcomes. By examining these opportunities and challenges, the report aims to show how data can benefit the lives of poor people in low- and middle-income countries"--},

  abstract = {Because of its high spatial resolution (10 m and 20 m), rich spectral information (10 spectral bands), and short revisit period (5 days), Sentinel-2 provides new opportunities for earth observation. However, in urban environments, data limitations in the spatial and spectral dimensions constrain Sentinel-2’s performance: (i) the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 is not sufficient to resolve the heterogeneous urban landscapes, and the prevalence of mixed pixels lowers the performance of image classifiers; (ii) the spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 is not able to fully account for the spectral variability of urban surface materials, which increases the probability that image classifiers mislabels urban land covers. Also, the 5-day temporal resolution makes Sentinel-2 image data suitable for time series analysis, but its contribution to urban land cover mapping still needs to be quantified. This study evaluated Sentinel-2’s performance in mapping urban land covers by mitigating the effect of spectral variability (using FDA, Fisher Discriminant Analysis), improving the spatial resolution of images (using UnFuSen2, a state-of-art Sentinel-2 image fusion approach), and utilizing temporal and spectral characteristics from image time series. Overall, we found that the image time series processed by UnFuSen2 enables the classifiers of k nearest neighbor (KNN), maximum likelihood (MLC), and random forests (RF) to perform the best, and multiple endmember spectra mixture analysis (MESMA) is suitable for classifying image time series that have been jointly processed by FDA and UnFuSen2. Besides, we found a significant contribution of spring and summer imagery to the improvement of land cover mapping accuracy in the Brussels Capital Region.},
