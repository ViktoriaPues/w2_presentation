  abstract = {Significance             Satellite imagery is becoming ubiquitous. Research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence applied to satellite imagery holds promise for automated detection of war-related building destruction. While these results are promising, monitoring in real-world applications requires high precision, especially when destruction is sparse and detecting destroyed buildings is equivalent to looking for a needle in a haystack. We demonstrate that exploiting the persistent nature of building destruction can substantially improve the training of automated destruction monitoring. We also propose an additional machine-learning stage that leverages images of surrounding areas and multiple successive images of the same area, which further improves detection significantly. This will allow real-world applications, and we illustrate this in the context of the Syrian civil war.           ,              Existing data on building destruction in conflict zones rely on eyewitness reports or manual detection, which makes it generally scarce, incomplete, and potentially biased. This lack of reliable data imposes severe limitations for media reporting, humanitarian relief efforts, human-rights monitoring, reconstruction initiatives, and academic studies of violent conflict. This article introduces an automated method of measuring destruction in high-resolution satellite images using deep-learning techniques combined with label augmentation and spatial and temporal smoothing, which exploit the underlying spatial and temporal structure of destruction. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to the Syrian civil war and reconstruct the evolution of damage in major cities across the country. Our approach allows generating destruction data with unprecedented scope, resolution, and frequency—and makes use of the ever-higher frequency at which satellite imagery becomes available.},

  abstract = {Our cities are the frontier where the battle to achieve the global sustainable development agenda over the next decade would be won or lost. This requires an evidence-based approach to local decision-making and resource allocation, which can only be possible if current gaps in urban data are bridged. Earth observation (EO) offers opportunities to provide timely, spatially disaggregated information that supports this need. Spatially disaggregated information, which is also demanded by cities for forward planning and land management, has not received much attention largely due to three reasons: (i) the cost of generating this data through traditional methods remains high; (ii) the technical capacity in geospatial sciences in many countries is low due to a shortage of skilled professionals who can find and/or process available data; and (iii) the inertia against disturbing routine workflows and adopting new practices that are not imposed through legal requirements at the country level. In support of overcoming the first two challenges, this paper discusses the importance of EO data in the urban context, how it is already being used by some city leaders for decision making, and what other applications it offers in the realm of urban sustainability monitoring. It also illustrates how the EO community, via the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and its members, is working to make this data more easily accessible and lower barriers of use by policymakers and urban practitioners that are interested in implementing and tracking sustainable development in their jurisdictions. The paper concludes by shining a light on the challenges that remain to be overcome for better adoption of EO data for urban decision making through better communication between the two groups, to enable a more effective alignment of the produced data with the users’ needs.},

  abstract = {"The unprecedented growth of data and its ubiquity in our daily lives signal that the digital revolution is transforming the world. But despite this growth, much of the value of data remains untapped, waiting to be realized. Data collected for one particular purpose has the potential to generate economic value in applications far beyond those originally anticipated. However, many barriers stand in the way of such beneficial reuse of data, ranging from misaligned incentives and incompatible data systems to a fundamental lack of trust. The World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives will explore the tremendous potential of the changing data landscape to improve the lives of poor people, but also to open backdoors that can harm individuals, businesses, and societies. The first part of the report assesses how better use and reuse of data can enhance the design of public policies, programs, and service delivery, as well as improve market efficiency and job creation through private sector growth. The second part of the report focuses on issues of governance, law, policy, and infrastructure that can help realize data's potential benefits while safeguarding against harmful outcomes. By examining these opportunities and challenges, the report aims to show how data can benefit the lives of poor people in low- and middle-income countries"--},

  abstract = {Because of its high spatial resolution (10 m and 20 m), rich spectral information (10 spectral bands), and short revisit period (5 days), Sentinel-2 provides new opportunities for earth observation. However, in urban environments, data limitations in the spatial and spectral dimensions constrain Sentinel-2’s performance: (i) the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 is not sufficient to resolve the heterogeneous urban landscapes, and the prevalence of mixed pixels lowers the performance of image classifiers; (ii) the spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 is not able to fully account for the spectral variability of urban surface materials, which increases the probability that image classifiers mislabels urban land covers. Also, the 5-day temporal resolution makes Sentinel-2 image data suitable for time series analysis, but its contribution to urban land cover mapping still needs to be quantified. This study evaluated Sentinel-2’s performance in mapping urban land covers by mitigating the effect of spectral variability (using FDA, Fisher Discriminant Analysis), improving the spatial resolution of images (using UnFuSen2, a state-of-art Sentinel-2 image fusion approach), and utilizing temporal and spectral characteristics from image time series. Overall, we found that the image time series processed by UnFuSen2 enables the classifiers of k nearest neighbor (KNN), maximum likelihood (MLC), and random forests (RF) to perform the best, and multiple endmember spectra mixture analysis (MESMA) is suitable for classifying image time series that have been jointly processed by FDA and UnFuSen2. Besides, we found a significant contribution of spring and summer imagery to the improvement of land cover mapping accuracy in the Brussels Capital Region.},
