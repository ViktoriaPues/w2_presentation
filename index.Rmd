# What is sentinel-2?

.pull-left[
#### Background: 
  - The sentinels (1 & 2) are a fleet of satellites by the European Space Agency to deliver data for the European Commission’s Copernicus Programme.
- The focus of the programme is to better understand the environment, tackle the effects of climate change and safeguard everyday lives. 
- There are 3 Copernicus Sentinel-2 missions (A,B & C) launched between 2015 and 2024. 
]

.pull-right[
  #### Key facts about sentinel-2: 
- Twin satellites flying in the same orbit but phased at 180°
- 5 day revisit time for any point on earth 
- Data is released under an Open Data policy
- Resolution 10 m 
- 13 spectral bands
- 290km swath (width of the Earth's surface that is covered)

# How is sentinel-2 data used? 

Sentinel-2 data is often used for environmental and climate change monitoring:  
- Agricultural applications such as crop monitoring and management, 
- Vegetation and forest monitoring (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll concentration, carbon mass estimations), 
- Monitoring land cover change for environmental monitoring, 
- Observation of coastal zones (marine environmental monitoring, coastal zone mapping), 
- Inland water monitoring, 
- Glacier monitoring, ice extent and snow cover mapping.

# Some reflection... 

... from the perspective of the development and humanitarian sector: 
- Sentinel-2 data have the potential to be used in ther international development and humanitarian context due to its open data policy. 
- It seems to be highly relevant for issues related to environment and climate change. 
- There seems to be limitations in urban environments due to its spatial resolution, which is not sufficient to resolve heterogeneous urban landscapes increasing the probability for misslabeling urban land covers. 
- However, for cities that have very limited to no data, a high level urban land cover classification based on sentinel-2 data may be a great first step towards better understanding the urban fabric and typoligies.
- I wonder if there are other free satelites that have a higher resolution and that can be better used for urban environments?
